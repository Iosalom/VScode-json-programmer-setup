# VScode-json-programmer-setup

This JSON file is specifically for settings.json file in Visual Studio Code settings. 
My desire is to look my VScode setup nice and matching to my expectations.

üöß... WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO in VScode:
  1. Download Tokyo Night extention, Highlight Matching Tag extention, Indent Rainbow extention & Prettier extention.
  2. Paste VScode-programmer-setup.json code in settings.json file in VScode settings.
  3. Adjust fonts and themes(based on preferences)(if you prefare different theme, it'll be there). ...üöß

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è: If you try and RUN this code as an ordinary JSON file it wont work. 
              Due to commentating disallowance for .json files, since it is data only.

Just in case you dislike this setup you can always search online or look directly in VScode.         

WISH YOU HAPPY DAY üíô... BY iCoder0001
